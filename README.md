# Hubot：一种家用机器人

Hubot 是一个聊天机器人, hubot 仿照GitHub's Campfire bot(篝火机器人)制作而成. 它非常的酷. 
He's [extendable with scripts](http://hubot.github.com/docs/#scripts) and can work on [many
different chat services](https://hubot.github.com/docs/adapters/).

This repository provides a library that's distributed by `npm` that you
use for building your own bots.  See the [documentation](http://hubot.github.com/docs)
for details on getting up and running with your very own robot friend.

In most cases, you'll probably never have to hack on this repo directly if you
are building your own bot. But if you do, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

If you'd like to chat, drop by [#hubot](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#hubot) on FreeNode IRC.
